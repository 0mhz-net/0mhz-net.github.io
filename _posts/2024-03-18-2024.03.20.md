title: 0MHz DOS Collection 2024.03.20 released
published: true
---

This is the first proper release of the new 0MHz DOS Collection, and we’re excited to share it with you!

**The goal of the 0MHz Collection is to “consolize” the ao486/DOS experience on MiSTer, and make gaming on the PC core as easy as any other console core that is supported.**

## Advantages

**Simple Launcher** — The 0MHz DOS Collection uses MiSTer’s MGL support to let you launch straight into any of the games directly from the top-level `DOS Games` menu.

**One Game, One Setup** — Each game is configured as a separate container, running the game off a dedicated (virtual) hard drive file. All relevant settings are in place — appropriate CPU speed, necessary drivers, memory managers, and anything else needed to play the game.

**Only the Classics** — Only the best of DOS gaming is included. Especially if you are new to the platform, we try to make it easier to find something you like. Most of the major hits from back in the day (based on various online top lists) are included, and complete game series too.

**Pick & Choose** — Instead of downloading every DOS games in existence, just pick the ones you want to play, since they are all standalone setups. Whether that means only your own personal top 5 DOS games, or the top 100.

**NFC Compatible** — Since it relies entirely on MiSTer’s MGL support, these games can be launched using the NFC reader, should you want to.

**Simple Installation** — Just copy the files to your MiSTer, and you are ready to go. No setup needed.

## Help us make it better

In the future, we have plans to add new features like QR code support so you can pull up the game manual directly on your phone when launching the game, and we may also look into making a PC XT DOS collection that works in the same way as this setup does. We have lots of ideas for the future. If you want to help out, just let us know!

If you find any issues, or want to suggest games that we may have forgotten, file a ticket in the [GitHub issue tracker](https://github.com/0mhz-net/0mhz-collection/issues).
